# ðŸš‚ Railway Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your MCP-enabled GA4/GSC Chatbot to Railway.

## Prerequisites

âœ… GitHub account with this repository  
âœ… Railway account (sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app))  
âœ… All environment variables ready (see `env.example`)  
âœ… Google OAuth credentials configured  

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Create Railway Project

**Option A: Via Web (Recommended)**

1. Go to [https://railway.app/new](https://railway.app/new)
2. Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Authorize Railway to access your GitHub account
4. Select this repository
5. Click "Deploy Now"

**Option B: Via CLI**

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login
railway login

# Initialize project
railway init

# Deploy
railway up
```

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

In Railway Dashboard â†’ Your Project â†’ Variables tab, add these variables:

```env
# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key

# Google OAuth
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/auth/google/callback

# OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Optional
GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
```

### Step 3: Generate Railway Domain

1. Railway Dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ Domains
2. Click "Generate Domain"
3. Copy the generated URL (e.g., `your-app.up.railway.app`)

### Step 4: Update Google OAuth

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console â†’ Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Edit your OAuth 2.0 Client ID
3. Add to **Authorized redirect URIs**:
   ```
   https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/auth/google/callback
   ```
4. Save changes

### Step 5: Update Environment Variable

Back in Railway Dashboard â†’ Variables:

Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_REDIRECT_URI` with your Railway domain:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/auth/google/callback
```

Railway will automatically redeploy when you save.

### Step 6: Verify Deployment

1. **Check Build Logs**
   - Railway Dashboard â†’ Deployments â†’ Latest deployment
   - Look for:
     ```
     âœ“ analytics-mcp installed successfully
     âœ“ Building Next.js application
     âœ“ Build completed
     âœ“ Server listening on port 3000
     ```

2. **Test Application**
   - Visit: `https://your-app.up.railway.app`
   - Login with your credentials
   - Navigate to `/chat`

3. **Test GA4 Connection**
   - Click "Connections" â†’ "Connect" for GA4
   - Complete OAuth flow
   - Should see "Successfully connected to Google Analytics 4!"

4. **Test Chat with MCP**
   - Send message: "Show me GA4 page views for last 7 days"
   - Check Railway logs for MCP server startup
   - Verify response with actual data

## Architecture on Railway

### File Structure
```
/app/                          # Railway app directory (writable)
â”œâ”€â”€ .next/                     # Next.js build output
â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules/              # Node.js dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ mcp-credentials/           # User credential files (created at runtime)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ {userId}-{service}.json
â””â”€â”€ .local/bin/                # pipx binaries
    â””â”€â”€ analytics-mcp          # Python MCP server
```

### Process Management

Railway runs your app as a **single long-running Node.js process**:

```
Railway Container
â””â”€â”€ Node.js Server (next start)
    â”œâ”€â”€ Per-user MCP subprocesses:
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ analytics-mcp (Python) for User A
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mcp-server-gsc (Node.js) for User A
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ analytics-mcp (Python) for User B
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
    â””â”€â”€ Connection Pool manages all subprocesses
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: `analytics-mcp: command not found`

**Cause:** pipx installation failed during build

**Solution:**

Check build logs for errors. If needed, update `nixpacks.toml`:

```toml
[phases.install]
cmds = [
  'npm ci',
  'pip install pipx',
  'export PIPX_HOME=/app/.pipx',
  'export PIPX_BIN_DIR=/app/.local/bin',
  'mkdir -p /app/.local/bin',
  'pipx install analytics-mcp',
  'ls -la /app/.local/bin'  # Verify installation
]
```

### Issue: OAuth redirect mismatch

**Cause:** Redirect URI doesn't match Google OAuth console

**Solution:**

1. Check Railway domain is correct
2. Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_REDIRECT_URI` matches exactly
3. Ensure no trailing slashes
4. Wait a few minutes for Google OAuth cache to clear

### Issue: Credentials file write error

**Cause:** Wrong path or permissions

**Solution:**

Check Railway logs. The app should log:
```
Created credentials directory at: /app/mcp-credentials
```

If you see `/var/task` or other paths, the environment detection failed.

### Issue: MCP connection fails

**Cause:** Multiple possible reasons

**Debug steps:**

1. **Check Railway logs:**
   ```bash
   railway logs
   ```

2. **Look for:**
   - "Starting GA4 MCP server with persistent credentials"
   - "Successfully connected to GA4 MCP server"
   - Any error messages

3. **Common fixes:**
   - Restart deployment: Railway Dashboard â†’ Deployments â†’ Redeploy
   - Clear connection: Disconnect and reconnect GA4/GSC
   - Check credentials in Supabase `mcp_connections` table

### Issue: Slow response times

**Cause:** Cold starts or connection pooling issues

**Solution:**

- First request after idle: 3-5 seconds (normal)
- Subsequent requests: < 1 second
- If consistently slow, upgrade to Railway Pro for better resources

## Monitoring

### View Logs

**Via Dashboard:**
Railway Dashboard â†’ Deployments â†’ Logs

**Via CLI:**
```bash
railway logs --follow
```

### Check Metrics

Railway Dashboard â†’ Metrics:
- **CPU:** Should be low, spikes during MCP startup
- **Memory:** 500MB-1GB with active connections
- **Network:** Depends on GA4 API usage

### Important Logs to Monitor

```
# Successful MCP connection
âœ“ Starting GA4 MCP server with persistent credentials: /app/mcp-credentials/...
âœ“ Successfully connected to GA4 MCP server

# Tool execution
Tool called: get_report
Tool result received from google-analytics: ...

# Connection cleanup
Closed active connection for google-analytics, user: ...
```

## Costs & Scaling

### Free Tier (Starter)
- **Execution Hours:** 500/month
- **Good for:** Development, testing, low traffic
- **Limits:** Auto-sleep after inactivity

### Pro Plan ($5/month)
- **Execution Hours:** Unlimited
- **Good for:** Production use
- **Benefits:**
  - No sleep
  - Better performance
  - Priority support
  - Custom domains

### Estimate for Your App

**Active Users:**
- 10 concurrent users: ~200 hours/month âœ… Free tier OK
- 50+ concurrent users: Pro plan recommended

**Memory Usage:**
- Each user with both services: ~150 MB
- 10 users: ~1.5 GB total
- Railway provides up to 8 GB on Pro

## Custom Domain (Optional)

### Add Custom Domain

1. Railway Dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ Domains
2. Click "Custom Domain"
3. Enter your domain: `chatbot.yourdomain.com`

### Update DNS

Add CNAME record:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: chatbot
Value: your-app.up.railway.app
TTL: 3600
```

### Update Environment Variables

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_REDIRECT_URI=https://chatbot.yourdomain.com/api/auth/google/callback
```

Update Google OAuth Console with new redirect URI.

## Backups & Persistence

### Credential Files

Stored in `/app/mcp-credentials/` which persists across deployments.

**However:** Railway can reset `/app` on container rebuilds.

**Recommendation:**
- Credentials are also stored in Supabase `mcp_connections` table
- On connection check, files are recreated if missing
- Consider enabling Railway persistent volumes for critical data

### Database

- Supabase handles all database backups
- No action needed on Railway side

## Support

### Railway Support
- Docs: [docs.railway.app](https://docs.railway.app)
- Discord: [railway.app/discord](https://railway.app/discord)
- Priority support with Pro plan

### Application Issues
- Check Railway logs first
- Review MCP connection status in `/chat`
- Verify environment variables

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. âœ… Test all features thoroughly
2. âœ… Monitor logs for first few connections
3. âœ… Set up error tracking (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)
4. âœ… Configure custom domain
5. âœ… Upgrade to Pro if needed
6. âœ… Set up CI/CD for automatic deployments
