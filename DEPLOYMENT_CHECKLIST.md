# üöÄ Railway Deployment Checklist

## ‚úÖ Changes Made (Automatically)

I've prepared your application for Railway deployment:

### Files Created:
- ‚úÖ `nixpacks.toml` - Railway build configuration
- ‚úÖ `.railwayignore` - Files to exclude from deployment
- ‚úÖ `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Complete deployment guide
- ‚úÖ `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` - This file

### Files Modified:
- ‚úÖ `package.json` - Added postinstall script for analytics-mcp, Node.js version requirements, and PORT binding
- ‚úÖ `lib/mcp/credential-manager.ts` - Railway-safe credential paths (/app directory)
- ‚úÖ `env.example` - Added Railway deployment notes

## üìã Your Action Items

### Step 1: Commit Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Railway deployment configuration"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Create Railway Account
1. Go to [https://railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Authorize Railway to access your repositories

### Step 3: Deploy to Railway

**Via Web (Easiest):**
1. Click "Start a New Project"
2. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Choose this repository
4. Click "Deploy Now"

**Via CLI:**
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

### Step 4: Generate Domain
1. Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Settings
2. Under "Domains" ‚Üí Click "Generate Domain"
3. Copy the URL (e.g., `your-app.up.railway.app`)

### Step 5: Configure Environment Variables

In Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Variables tab, add:

```env
# Required - Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJ...

# Required - Google OAuth
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=xxx.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=GOCSPX-xxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/auth/google/callback

# Required - OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Optional
GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** Replace `your-app.up.railway.app` with your actual Railway domain!

### Step 6: Update Google OAuth Console

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Select your OAuth 2.0 Client ID
3. Add to "Authorized redirect URIs":
   ```
   https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/auth/google/callback
   ```
4. Click "Save"

### Step 7: Verify Deployment

1. **Check Build Logs:**
   - Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí Latest
   - Look for:
     - ‚úÖ "analytics-mcp installed successfully"
     - ‚úÖ "Build completed"
     - ‚úÖ "Server listening on port 3000"

2. **Test Application:**
   - Visit your Railway URL
   - Login to your account
   - Navigate to `/chat`
   - Click "Connections" ‚Üí Connect to GA4
   - Complete OAuth flow
   - Send a test message

3. **Verify MCP Works:**
   - Ask: "Show me GA4 page views for last 7 days"
   - Check logs for MCP server startup
   - Verify you get actual data

## üîç Verification Commands

### Check Railway Logs
```bash
railway logs --follow
```

### Successful Deployment Should Show:
```
‚úì Starting build...
‚úì Installing dependencies
‚úì analytics-mcp installed successfully
‚úì Building Next.js application
‚úì Build completed
‚úì Starting server on port 3000
‚úì Ready on http://0.0.0.0:3000
```

### When User Connects GA4:
```
Created credentials directory at: /app/mcp-credentials
Starting GA4 MCP server with persistent credentials: /app/mcp-credentials/xxx-google-analytics.json
Successfully connected to GA4 MCP server
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "analytics-mcp: command not found"
**Fix:** Redeploy from Railway dashboard. Check build logs for pipx errors.

### Issue: OAuth redirect mismatch
**Fix:** 
1. Verify Railway domain matches `NEXT_PUBLIC_REDIRECT_URI`
2. Check Google OAuth console has exact redirect URI
3. No trailing slashes!

### Issue: "read-only file system" error
**Fix:** Should NOT happen now. `credential-manager.ts` uses `/app` directory.
If you see this, check Railway logs for the credentials path being used.

### Issue: MCP connection times out
**Fix:**
1. Check Railway logs for Python errors
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Try disconnecting and reconnecting from UI

## üìä Expected Performance

- **Initial deployment:** 8-12 minutes
- **Subsequent deploys:** 3-5 minutes
- **Cold start (first request):** 3-5 seconds
- **Warm requests:** < 1 second
- **Memory usage:** 500MB-1GB

## üí∞ Cost Estimate

**Free Tier:**
- 500 execution hours/month
- Perfect for development & testing
- Sleeps after inactivity

**Pro Plan ($5/month):**
- Unlimited execution hours
- No sleep
- Better performance
- Recommended for production

**Your Usage:**
- 10 concurrent users ‚âà 200 hours/month ‚úÖ Free tier OK
- 50+ users ‚Üí Consider Pro plan

## üéØ Success Criteria
