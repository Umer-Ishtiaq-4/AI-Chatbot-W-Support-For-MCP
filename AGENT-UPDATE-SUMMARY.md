# Agent Loop & Conversation History - Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### ‚úÖ Feature 1: Conversation History (Last 10 Messages)

**What it does:**
- Loads the last 10 messages from the database for every chat request
- Passes them to GPT-4o as context
- Allows the AI to remember previous conversation and provide context-aware responses

**Code Location:** `app/api/chat/route.ts` lines 33-49

**Example:**
```
User: "Show me my GA4 accounts"
AI: "You have: My Website (123456)"

User: "What properties does it have?" ‚Üê AI remembers "it" = My Website
AI: "The account 'My Website' has 2 properties..."
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Better follow-up questions
- ‚úÖ Natural conversation flow
- ‚úÖ No need to repeat context

---

### ‚úÖ Feature 2: Agent Loop (Multi-Step Tool Calling)

**What it does:**
- The AI can now call **multiple tools in sequence** until it has enough information
- Automatically decides when to stop calling tools and provide final answer
- Maximum 5 iterations to prevent infinite loops

**Code Location:** `app/api/chat/route.ts` lines 99-210

**How it works:**

```
Loop (max 5 iterations):
  1. Ask GPT-4o: "What do you need to do?"
  
  2. GPT-4o decides:
     - Option A: Call a tool ‚Üí Execute it ‚Üí Add result ‚Üí Loop back to step 1
     - Option B: Provide final answer ‚Üí Done!
```

**Example:**
```
User asks: "Compare my traffic from last week to this week"

Iteration 1:
  AI: "I need properties first"
  Tool: get_account_summaries()
  
Iteration 2:
  AI: "Now get last week's data"
  Tool: run_report(last_week)
  
Iteration 3:
  AI: "Now get this week's data"
  Tool: run_report(this_week)
  
Iteration 4:
  AI: "I have both datasets!"
  Final answer: "Last week: 15K sessions. This week: 18K sessions (+21%)"
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Handles complex queries automatically
- ‚úÖ Chains multiple API calls without user intervention
- ‚úÖ More intelligent and autonomous
- ‚úÖ Better answers for analytics questions

## Technical Implementation

### Message Flow

```typescript
// 1. Load conversation history
const recentMessages = await supabase
  .from('messages')
  .select('role, content')
  .eq('user_id', userId)
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false })
  .limit(10);

// 2. Build messages array
const messages = [
  { role: 'system', content: systemPrompt },
  ...conversationHistory,  // ‚Üê Last 10 messages
  { role: 'user', content: newMessage }
];

// 3. Agent loop
while (iteration < MAX_ITERATIONS) {
  const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    messages: messages,
    functions: ga4Tools
  });
  
  if (completion.function_call) {
    // Execute tool
    const result = await callTool(completion.function_call);
    messages.push(result);
    // Loop continues...
  } else {
    // Final answer ready!
    return completion.content;
  }
}
```

## Logging Output

When you test this, you'll see detailed logs like:

```
Chat request - User: abc123 GA4 Connected: true
Dynamically loaded GA4 tools: [
  'get_account_summaries',
  'run_report',
  'run_realtime_report',
  ...
]

=== Agent Iteration 1 ===
Tool called: get_account_summaries
Arguments: {}
Tool result received: {"accountSummaries":[...

=== Agent Iteration 2 ===
Tool called: run_report
Arguments: {"property_id":"properties/123456","start_date":"2024-10-01"...
Tool result received: {"rows":[...

=== Agent Iteration 3 ===
Final answer received (no more tool calls)
```

## Performance Impact

### Before This Update:
- ‚ùå No conversation memory
- ‚ùå Only 1 tool call allowed per query
- ‚ùå Couldn't handle "Compare X to Y" queries
- ‚ùå Couldn't chain multiple API calls

### After This Update:
- ‚úÖ Remembers last 10 messages
- ‚úÖ Up to 5 tool calls per query
- ‚úÖ Handles complex analytics queries
- ‚úÖ Chains API calls automatically

### API Call Count:
- **Simple question**: 1 API call (no tools)
- **Single tool query**: 2 API calls (1 to decide + 1 for final answer)
- **Multi-tool query**: 2-5 API calls depending on complexity

---

## Configuration

### Adjust Conversation History Length

In `app/api/chat/route.ts` line 46:
```typescript
.limit(10)  // Change to 5, 15, 20, etc.
```

**Recommendations:**
- **5 messages**: Lower cost, less context
- **10 messages**: Good balance (default)
- **20 messages**: Better memory, higher cost

### Adjust Max Agent Iterations

In `app/api/chat/route.ts` line 100:
```typescript
const MAX_ITERATIONS = 5;  // Change to 3, 7, 10, etc.
```

**Recommendations:**
- **3 iterations**: Fast, might not complete complex queries
- **5 iterations**: Good balance (default)
- **10 iterations**: Very thorough, higher cost

## Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Conversation Memory
```
1. Ask: "What's my account name?"
   Expected: AI calls get_account_summaries and tells you

2. Ask: "What properties are in that account?"
   Expected: AI remembers the account name from step 1
```

### Test 2: Multi-Step Query
```
Ask: "Show me my top 5 pages from the last 7 days"

Expected agent behavior:
  Iteration 1: get_account_summaries (to find property)
  Iteration 2: run_report (to get top pages)
  Iteration 3: Final answer with formatted data
```

### Test 3: Complex Comparison
```
Ask: "Compare my sessions from last week to this week"

Expected agent behavior:
  Iteration 1: get_account_summaries
  Iteration 2: run_report (last week data)
  Iteration 3: run_report (this week data)
  Iteration 4: Final answer with comparison
```

## Status: ‚úÖ Complete and Ready to Test!

Try asking complex questions like:
