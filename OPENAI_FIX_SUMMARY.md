# OpenAI Client Build Fix

## The Problem
After fixing Supabase, the build failed with:
```
Error: The OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is missing or empty
```

This happened because the OpenAI client in `app/api/chat/route.ts` was being initialized at **module import time** (during build), not at runtime.

## The Solution
Changed from module-level initialization to lazy loading using a getter function.

### Before (‚ùå Fails during build):
```typescript
const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
})
```

### After (‚úÖ Works):
```typescript
let openaiInstance: OpenAI | null = null;

function getOpenAIClient() {
  if (!openaiInstance) {
    const apiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;
    if (!apiKey) {
      throw new Error('OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is required');
    }
    openaiInstance = new OpenAI({ apiKey });
  }
  return openaiInstance;
}

// Usage: getOpenAIClient().chat.completions.create(...)
```

## Files Modified
1. **`app/api/chat/route.ts`**
   - Added `getOpenAIClient()` lazy loader
   - Added `getSupabaseConfig()` lazy loader (for this route's Supabase usage)
   - Updated 3 places: `openai.chat.completions.create()` ‚Üí `getOpenAIClient().chat.completions.create()`

2. **`lib/supabase.ts`** (already fixed in previous step)
   - Lazy-loaded using Proxy pattern

## Why This Works
- **Build time**: Only imports the module, no env vars needed ‚úÖ
- **Runtime**: Creates client on first use when env vars are available ‚úÖ
- **Performance**: Client is cached after first creation (singleton pattern) ‚úÖ

## Complete Fix Stack
All three issues resolved:
1. ‚úÖ Supabase client (Proxy pattern in `lib/supabase.ts`)
2. ‚úÖ OpenAI client (getter function in `app/api/chat/route.ts`)
3. ‚úÖ Supabase config (getter function in `app/api/chat/route.ts`)

## Next Steps
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Lazy-load OpenAI and Supabase clients for Railway build"
git push origin main
```

Railway will auto-deploy and the build should succeed! üöÄ
